The results on decoding replicated earlier findings on the ability of judges to infer vocally expressed emotions with much-better-than-chance accuracy, including consistently found differences in the recognizability of different emotions. A total of 224 portrayals were subjected to digital acoustical analysis to obtain profiles of vocal parameters for different emotions. The data suggest that vocal parameters not only index the degree of intensity typical for different emotions but also differentiate valence or quality aspects. The data are also used to test theoretical predictions on vocal patterning based on the component process of model of emotion (K. R. Scherer, see record 1986-16849-001). Although most hypotheses are supported, some need to be revised on the basis of the empirical evidence. Discriminant analysis and jackknifing show remarkably high hit rates and patterns of confusion that closely mirror those found for listener-judges.

  abstract = {It is commonly assumed that a person's emotional state can be readily inferred from his or her facial movements, typically called emotional expressions or facial expressions. This assumption influences legal judgments, policy decisions, national security protocols, and educational practices; guides the diagnosis and treatment of psychiatric illness, as well as the development of commercial applications; and pervades everyday social interactions as well as research in other scientific fields such as artificial intelligence, neuroscience, and computer vision. In this article, we survey examples of this widespread assumption, which we refer to as the common view, and we then examine the scientific evidence that tests this view, focusing on the six most popular emotion categories used by consumers of emotion research: anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise. The available scientific evidence suggests that people do sometimes smile when happy, frown when sad, scowl when angry, and so on, as proposed by the common view, more than what would be expected by chance. Yet how people communicate anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, and surprise varies substantially across cultures, situations, and even across people within a single situation. Furthermore, similar configurations of facial movements variably express instances of more than one emotion category. In fact, a given configuration of facial movements, such as a scowl, often communicates something other than an emotional state. Scientists agree that facial movements convey a range of information and are important for social communication, emotional or otherwise. But our review suggests an urgent need for research that examines how people actually move their faces to express emotions and other social information in the variety of contexts that make up everyday life, as well as careful study of the mechanisms by which people perceive instances of emotion in one another. We make specific research recommendations that will yield a more valid picture of how people move their faces to express emotions and how they infer emotional meaning from facial movements in situations of everyday life. This research is crucial to provide consumers of emotion research with the translational information they require.},

Method       We implement a novel tool, the Test for Rating of Emotions in Speech. Eighty native          English speakers were presented with spoken sentences made of different combinations          of 5 discrete emotions (anger, fear, happiness, sadness, and neutral) presented in          prosody and semantics. Listeners were asked to rate the sentence as a whole, integrating          both speech channels, or to focus on one channel only (prosody or semantics).              Results       We observed supremacy of congruency, failure of selective attention, and prosodic          dominance. Supremacy of congruency means that a sentence that presents the same emotion          in both speech channels was rated highest; failure of selective attention means that          listeners were unable to selectively attend to one channel when instructed; and prosodic          dominance means that prosodic information plays a larger role than semantics in processing          emotional speech.              Conclusions       Emotional prosody and semantics are separate but not separable channels, and it is          difficult to perceive one without the influence of the other. Our findings indicate          that the Test for Rating of Emotions in Speech can reveal specific aspects in the          processing of emotional speech and may in the future prove useful for understanding          emotion-processing deficits in individuals with pathologies.},

Such data typologies are becoming obsolete in the face of new methods, technologies, and data philosophies. In this article, we discuss personality psychology's historical thinking about data, modern data theory's place in personality psychology, and several qualities of big data that urge a rethinking of personality itself. We call for a move away from self?report questionnaires and a reprioritization of the study of behaviour within personality science. With big data and behavioural assessment, we have the potential to witness the confluence of situated, seamlessly interacting psychological processes, forming an inclusive, dynamic, multiangle view of personality. However, big behavioural data come hand in hand with important ethical considerations, and our emerging ability to create a ?personality panopticon? requires careful and thoughtful navigation. For our research to improve and thrive in partnership with new technologies, we must not only wield our new tools thoughtfully, but humanely. Through discourse and collaboration with other disciplines and the general public, we can foster mutual growth and ensure that humanity's burgeoning technological capabilities serve, rather than control, the public interest. ? 2020 European Association of Personality Psychology},

Mobile sensing provides a promising tool and can capture one of the most telling signs of emotion: language. Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the separate and combined predictive value of mobile-sensed language data sources for detecting both momentary emotional experience as well as global individual differences in emotional traits and depression. Methods: In a 2-week experience sampling method study, we collected self-reported emotion ratings and voice recordings 10 times a day, continuous keyboard activity, and trait depression severity. We correlated state and trait emotions and depression and language, distinguishing between speech content (spoken words), speech form (voice acoustics), writing content (written words), and writing form (typing dynamics). We also investigated how well these features predicted state and trait emotions using cross-validation to select features and a hold-out set for validation. Results: Overall, the reported emotions and mobile-sensed language demonstrated weak correlations. The most significant correlations were found between speech content and state emotions and between speech form and state emotions, ranging up to 0.25. Speech content provided the best predictions for state emotions. None of the trait emotion--language correlations remained significant after correction. Among the emotions studied, valence and happiness displayed the most significant correlations and the highest predictive performance.

  abstract = {Emotional vocalizations are central to human social life. Recent studies have documented that people recognize at least 13 emotions in brief vocalizations. This capacity emerges early in development, is preserved in some form across cultures, and informs how people respond emotionally to music. What is poorly understood is how emotion recognition from vocalization is structured within what we call a semantic space, the study of which addresses questions critical to the field: How many distinct kinds of emotions can be expressed? Do expressions convey emotion categories or affective appraisals (e.g., valence, arousal)? Is the recognition of emotion expressions discrete or continuous? Guided by a new theoretical approach to emotion taxonomies, we apply large-scale data collection and analysis techniques to judgments of 2,032 emotional vocal bursts produced in laboratory settings (Study 1) and 48 found in the real world (Study 2) by U.S. English speakers (N = 1,105). We find that vocal bursts convey at least 24 distinct kinds of emotion. Emotion categories (sympathy, awe), more so than affective appraisals (including valence and arousal), organize emotion recognition. In contrast to discrete emotion theories, the emotion categories conveyed by vocal bursts are bridged by smooth gradients with continuously varying meaning. We visualize the complex, high-dimensional space of emotion conveyed by brief human vocalization within an online interactive map. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved).},

To explore the processes by which people recognize emotion from prosody, US and Indian participants were asked to judge the emotion categories or affective features communicated by 2,519 speech samples produced by 100 actors from five cultures. With large-scale statistical inference methods, we find that prosody can communicate at least 12 distinct kinds of emotion that are preserved across the two cultures. Analyses of the semantic and acoustic structure of emotion recognition reveal that emotion categories drive emotion recognition more so than affective features, including valence. In contrast to discrete emotion theories, however, emotion categories are bridged by gradients representing blends of emotions. Our findings, visualized within an interactive map (https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/venec/map.html), reveal a complex, high-dimensional space of emotional states recognized cross-culturally in speech prosody.},

Fresh insights include description of short-term interoceptive effects on neural and mental processes (including fear-specific cardiac effects), the recognition of dissociable psychological dimensions of interoception, and models of interoceptive predictive coding that explain emotions and selfhood (reinforced by structural anatomical models and brain and experimental findings).

The unambiguous assignment of semantic (emotional) content enables the study of prosody as an independent factor. Moreover, the sentences were balanced regarding average word frequency, average phonological neighborhood density, and number of syllables per sentence. This linguistic balance enables an unbiased evaluation of the roles of semantic content and prosody in emotional speech.},

The overarching goal of BigEAR is to identify moods of the wearer from various activities such as laughing, singing, crying, arguing, and sighing. These annotations are based on ground truth relevant for psychologists who intend to monitor/infer the social context of individuals coping with breast cancer. We pursued a case study on couples coping with breast cancer to know how the conversations affect emotional and social well being. In the state-of-the-art methods, psychologists and their team have to hear the audio recordings for making these inferences by subjective evaluations that not only are time-consuming and costly, but also demand manual data coding for thousands of audio files. The BigEAR framework automates the audio analysis. We computed the accuracy of BigEAR with respect to the ground truth obtained from a human rater. Our approach yielded overall average accuracy of 88.76\% on real-world data from couples coping with breast cancer.},

This chatbot mines various textual features from users' free text responses collected during an online conversation/interview and then uses machine learning algorithms to infer personality scores. We comprehensively examine the psychometric properties of the machine-inferred personality scores, including reliability (internal consistency, split-half, and test--retest), factorial validity, convergent and discriminant validity, and criterion-related validity. Participants were undergraduate students (n = 1,444) enrolled in a large southeastern public university in the United States who completed a self-report Big Five personality measure (IPIP-300) and engaged with an AI chatbot for approximately 20--30 min. In a subsample (n = 407), we obtained participants' cumulative grade point averages from the University Registrar and had their peers rate their college adjustment. In an additional sample (n = 61), we obtained test--retest data. Results indicated that machine-inferred personality scores (a) had overall acceptable reliability at both the domain and facet levels, (b) yielded a comparable factor structure to self-reported questionnaire-derived personality scores, (c) displayed good convergent validity but relatively poor discriminant validity (averaged convergent correlations = .48 vs. averaged machine-score correlations = .35 in the test sample), (d) showed low criterion-related validity, and (e) exhibited incremental validity over self-reported questionnaire-derived personality scores in some analyses. In addition, there was strong evidence for cross-sample generalizability of psychometric properties of machine scores. Theoretical implications, future research directions, and practical considerations are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Inferring human mental state (e.g., emotion, depression, engagement) with sensing technology is one of the most valuable challenges in the affective computing area, which has a profound impact in all industries interacting with humans. Self-report is the most common way to quantify how people think, but prone to subjectivity and various responses bias. It is usually used as the ground truth for human mental state prediction. In recent years, many data-driven machine learning models are built based on self-report annotations as the target value. In this research, we investigate the reliability of self-report data in the wild by studying the confidence level of responses and survey completion time. We conduct a case study (i.e., student engagement inference) by recruiting 23 students in a high school setting over a period of 4 weeks. Overall, our participants volunteered 488 self-reported responses and sensing data from smart wristbands. We find that the physiologically measured student engagement and perceived student engagement are not always consistent. The findings from this research have great potential to benefit future studies in predicting engagement, depression, stress, and other emotion-related states in the field of affective computing and sensing technologies.},

Because methodological guidance on assessing and reporting reliability at multiple levels of analysis is currently lacking, we discuss the importance of examining level-specific reliability. We present a simulation study and an applied example showing different methods for estimating multilevel reliability using multilevel confirmatory factor analysis and provide supporting Mplus program code. We conclude that (a) single-level estimates will not reflect a scale's actual reliability unless reliability is identical at each level of analysis, (b) 2-level alpha and composite reliability (omega) perform relatively well in most settings, (c) estimates of maximal reliability (H) were more biased when estimated using multilevel data than either alpha or omega, and (d) small cluster size can lead to overestimates of reliability at the between level of analysis. We also show that Monte Carlo confidence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals closely reflect the sampling distribution of reliability estimates under most conditions. We discuss the estimation of credible intervals using Mplus and provide R code for computing Monte Carlo confidence intervals.},

Which position provides a better account is still widely debated. Here we contrast the positions to account for acoustics-independent perceptual and cerebral representational geometry of perceived voice emotions. We combined multimodal imaging of the cerebral response to heard vocal stimuli (using functional magnetic resonance imaging and magneto-encephalography) with post-scanning behavioural assessment of voice emotion perception. By using representational similarity analysis, we find that categories prevail in perceptual and early (less than 200\,ms) frontotemporal cerebral representational geometries and that dimensions impinge predominantly on a later limbic--temporal network (at 240\,ms and after 500\,ms). These results reconcile the two opposing views by reframing the perception of emotions as the interplay of cerebral networks with different representational dynamics that emphasize either categories or dimensions.},

In recent years, it has become a common practice for scientists to design apps that run only on a single operating system, thereby excluding large numbers of users who use a different operating system. However, empirical evidence investigating any selection biases that might result thereof is scarce. Henceforth, we conducted two studies drawing from a large multi-national (Study 1; N = 1,081) and a German-speaking sample (Study 2; N = 2,438). As such Study 1 compared iOS and Android users across an array of key personality traits (i.e., well-being, self-esteem, willingness to take risks, optimism, pessimism, Dark Triad, and the Big Five). Focusing on Big Five personality traits in a broader scope, in addition to smartphone users, Study 2 also examined users of the main computer operating systems (i.e., Mac OS, Windows). In both studies, very few significant differences were found, all of which were of small or even tiny effect size mostly disappearing after sociodemographics had been controlled for. Taken together, minor differences in personality seem to exist, but they are of small to negligible effect size (ranging from OR = 0.919 to 1.344 (Study 1), {$\eta$}p2 = .005 to .036 (Study 2), respectively) and may reflect differences in sociodemographic composition, rather than operating system of smartphone users.},

In addition to the audio-visual data and the segmented utterances we provide emotion labels for a great part of the data. The emotion labels are given on a continuous valued scale for three emotion primitives: valence, activation and dominance, using a large number of human evaluators.

Based on an analysis of display rules, the authors hypothesized that expressivity would moderate the relation between experience and expression for negative, but not for positive, emotion. Study 1 examined the relation between habitual emotion experience and peer-rated expressive behavior and showed the predicted moderator effect for negative emotion: Experience was related to expression only for dispositionally high-expressivity participants, not for low-expressivity participants. For positive emotion, however, experience was related to expression for both groups. Study 2 replicated these findings using momentary emotion experience and objectively coded expressive behavior during films that elicited amusement and sadness. Results are interpreted in terms of low-expressivity individuals' propensity to dynamically regulate negative emotion-expressive behavior.},

Study 1 shows that self-reported expressivity has 3 facets (Impulse Strength, Negative Expressivity, Positive Expressivity). Study 2 shows that the same 3 facets emerge in peer ratings and that there are robust relations between self- and peer-rated expressivity. In Study 3, emotion-expressive behavior was videotaped and related to expressivity self-reports obtained several months earlier. As expected, Negative Expressivity predicted behavioral expressions of sadness (but not amusement), whereas Positive Expressivity predicted amusement (but not sadness). These relations remained even when subjective motional experience and physiological response were controlled. These studies demon-strate the importance of a multifaceted approach to emotional expressivity and have implications for the understanding of personality and emotion. Emotions help us respond adaptively to environmental chal-lenges and opportunities (Frijda, 1988; Levenson, 1994; Plut-chik, 1980). Unlike other biologically based response tenden-cies, such as reflexes, however, emotions only incline us to act in certain ways; they do not compel us to do so. This means that we may deny expression to some emotional impulses while freely expressing others. Striking individual differences in ex-pressivity suggest that people differ in their response tendencies and in how they express these impulses as they arise. Because emotions influence such a wide range of intra- and interpersonal},

However, little is known about the nature of the differences between student and representative samples. This is an important gap, also because knowledge about the degree of difference between student and representative samples may allow to infer from the former to the latter group. Across 59 countries and 12 personality (Big-5) and attitudinal variables we found that differences between students and general public were partly substantial, incoherent, and contradicted previous findings. Two often used cultural variables, embeddedness and intellectual autonomy, failed to explain the differences between both groups across countries. We further found that students vary as much as the general population both between and within countries. In summary, our results indicate that generalizing from students to the general public can be problematic when personal and attitudinal variables are used, as students vary mostly randomly from the general public. Findings are also discussed in terms of the replication crisis within psychology.},

Although within-utterance information about emotion changes recently has received some attention, there remain open questions unresolved, such as how to approach delta emotion ground truth, how to predict the extent of emotion change from speech, and how well change can be predicted relative to absolute emotion ratings. In this article, we investigate speech-based automatic systems for continuous prediction of the extent of emotion changes in arousal/valence. We propose the use of regression (smoothed) deltas as ground truth for emotion change, which yielded considerably higher inter-rater reliability than first-order deltas, a commonly used approach in previous research, and represent a more appropriate approach to derive annotations for emotion change research, findings which are applicable beyond speech-based systems. In addition, the first system design for continuous emotion change prediction from speech is explored. Experimental results under the Output-Associative Relevance Vector Machine framework interestingly show that changes in emotion ratings may be better predicted than absolute emotion ratings on the RECOLA database, achieving 0.74 vs. 0.71 for arousal and 0.41 vs. 0.37 for valence in concordance correlation coefficients. However, further work is needed to achieve effective emotion change prediction performances on the SEMAINE database, due to the large number of non-change frames in the absolute emotion ratings.},

According to these theories, the subjective perception of an emotion results from a series of specific event evaluations. To validate and extend one of the most known representatives of appraisal theory, the Component Process Model by Klaus Scherer, we implemented four computational appraisal models that predicted emotion labels based on prototype similarity calculations. Different weighting algorithms, mapping the models' input to a distinct emotion label, were integrated in the models. We evaluated the plausibility of the models' structure by assessing their predictive power and comparing their performance to a baseline model and a highly predictive machine learning algorithm. Model parameters were estimated from empirical data and validated out-of-sample. All models were notably better than the baseline model and able to explain part of the variance in the emotion labels. The preferred model, yielding a relatively high performance and stable parameter estimations, was able to predict a correct emotion label with an accuracy of 40.2\% and a correct emotion family with an accuracy of 76.9\%. The weighting algorithm of this favored model corresponds to the weighting complexity implied by the Component Process Model, but uses differing weighting parameters.},

  abstract = {The present study explored the interrelations between a broad set of appraisal ratings and five physiological signals, including facial EMG, electrodermal activity, and heart rate variability, that were assessed in 157 participants watching 10 emotionally charged videos. A total of 134 features were extracted from the physiological data, and a benchmark comparing different kinds of machine learning algorithms was conducted to test how well the appraisal dimensions can be predicted from these features. For 13 out of 21 appraisals, a robust positive R2 was attained, indicating that the dimensions are actually related to the considered physiological channels. The highest R2 (.407) was reached for the appraisal dimension intrinsic pleasantness. Moreover, the comparison of linear and nonlinear algorithms and the inspection of the links between the appraisals and single physiological features using accumulated local effects plots indicates that the relationship between physiology and appraisals is nonlinear. By constructing different importance measures for the assessed physiological channels, we showed that for the 13 predictable appraisals, the five channels explained different amounts of variance and that only a few blocks incrementally explained variance beyond the other physiological channels.},

Although some areas of research have benefited tremendously from a new set of statistical tools, most often in the use of biological or genetic variables, the hype has not been substantiated in more traditional areas of research. We argue that this phenomenon results from measurement errors that prevent machine-learning algorithms from accurately modeling nonlinear relationships, if indeed they exist. This shortcoming is showcased across a set of simulated examples, demonstrating that model selection between a machine-learning algorithm and regression depends on the measurement quality, regardless of sample size. We conclude with a set of recommendations and a discussion of ways to better integrate machine learning with statistics as traditionally practiced in psychological science.},

  abstract = {As voice dialog applications (VDAs, e.g., Siri,1 Cortana,2 Google Now3) are increasing in popularity, inferring emotions from the large-scale internet voice data generated from VDAs can help give a more reasonable and humane response. However, the tremendous amounts of users in large-scale internet voice data lead to a great diversity of users accents and expression patterns. Therefore, the traditional speech emotion recognition methods, which mainly target acted corpora, cannot effectively handle the massive and diverse amount of internet voice data. To address this issue, we carry out a series of observations, find suitable emotion categories for large-scale internet voice data, and verify the indicators of the social attributes (query time, query topic, and users location) and emotion inferring. Based on our observations, two different strategies are employed to solve the problem. First, a deep sparse neural network model that uses acoustic information, textual information, and three indicators (a temporal indicator, descriptive indicator, and geosocial indicator) as the input is proposed. Then, to capture the contextual information, we propose a hybrid emotion inference model that includes long short-term memory to capture the acoustic features and a latent dirichlet allocation to extract text features. Experiments on 93 000 utterances collected from the Sogou Voice Assistant4 (Chinese Siri) validate the effectiveness of the proposed methodologies. Furthermore, we compare the two methodologies and give their advantages and disadvantages.},

This study examines the effects of acting training on vocal emotion depiction and recognition. We predicted that professional actors express emotions in a more realistic fashion than non-professional actors. However, professional acting training may lead to a particular speech pattern; this might account for vocal expressions by actors that are less comparable to authentic samples than the ones by non-professional actors. We compared 80 emotional speech tokens from radio interviews with 80 re-enactments by professional and inexperienced actors, respectively. We analyzed recognition accuracies for emotion and authenticity ratings and compared the acoustic structure of the speech tokens. Both play-acted conditions yielded similar recognition accuracies and possessed more variable pitch contours than the spontaneous recordings. However, professional actors exhibited signs of different articulation patterns compared to non-trained speakers. Our results indicate that for emotion research, emotional expressions by professional actors are not better suited than those from non-actors.},

In the present investigation, we assembled a new database consisting of 1877 voice clips from 23 datasets, and used it to systematically compare spontaneous and posed expressions across 3 experiments. Results showed that (a) spontaneous expressions were generally rated as more genuinely emotional than were posed expressions, even when controlling for differences in emotion intensity, (b) there were differences between the two stimulus types with regard to their acoustic characteristics, and (c) spontaneous expressions with a high emotion intensity conveyed discrete emotions to listeners to a similar degree as has previously been found for posed expressions, supporting a dose--response relationship between intensity of expression and discreteness in perceived emotions. Our conclusion is that there are reliable differences between spontaneous and posed expressions, though not necessarily in the ways commonly assumed. Implications for emotion theories and the use of emotion portrayals in studies of vocal expression are discussed.},

In the present study, 384 clips of vocal expression recorded in a field setting were rated by the speakers themselves and by na{\"i}ve listeners with regard to their emotional contents. Results suggested that most expressions in everyday life are reflective of felt emotions in speakers. Seventy-three percent of the voice clips involved moderate to high emotion intensity. Speaker--listener agreement concerning expressed emotions was 5 times higher than would be expected from chance alone, and agreement was significantly higher for voice clips with high emotion intensity than for clips with low intensity. Acoustic analysis of the clips revealed emotion-specific patterns of voice cues. ``Mixed emotions'' occurred in 41\% of the clips. Such expressions were typically interpreted by listeners as conveying one or the other of the two felt emotions. Mixed emotions were rarely recognized as such. The results are discussed regarding their implications for the domain of emotional expression in general, and vocal expression in particular.

  abstract = {The recognition of affect in speech has attracted a lot of interest recently; especially in the area of cognitive and computer sciences. Most of the previous studies focused on the recognition of basic emotions (such as happiness, sadness and anger) using categorical approach. Recently, the focus has been shifting towards dimensional affect recognition based on the idea that emotional states are not independent from one another but related in a systematic manner. In this paper, we design a continuous dimensional speech affect recognition model that combines acoustic and semantic features. We design our own corpus that consists of 59 short movie clips with audio and text in subtitle format, rated by human subjects in arousal and valence (A-V) dimensions. For the acoustic part, we combine many features and use correlation based feature selection and apply support vector regression. For the semantic part, we use the affective norms for English words (ANEW), that are rated also in A-V dimensions, as keywords and apply latent semantics analysis (LSA) on those words and words in the clips to estimate A-V values in the clips. Finally, the results of acoustic and semantic parts are combined. We show that combining semantic and acoustic information for dimensional speech recognition improves the results. Moreover, we show that valence is better estimated using semantic features while arousal is better estimated using acoustic features.},

Half of the participants were asked to report on their emotional states and appraise their feelings throughout the experiment, whereas the other half completed a control questionnaire. Among those in the anger condition, participants assigned to report on their emotions exhibited qualitatively different physiological responses from those who did not report. For participants in the shame condition, there were no significant differences in physiology based on the self-report manipulation.

Text-responses use people's primary form of communication --               natural language               -- and have been suggested as a more ecologically-valid response format than closed-ended rating scales that dominate social science. However, previous language analysis techniques left a gap between how accurately they converged with standard rating scales and how well ratings scales converge with themselves -- a theoretical upper-limit in accuracy. Most recently, AI-based language analysis has gone through a transformation as nearly all of its applications, from Web search to personalized assistants (e.g., Alexa and Siri), have shown unprecedented improvement by using transformers. We evaluate transformers for estimating psychological well-being from questionnaire text- and descriptive word-responses, and find accuracies converging with rating scales that approach the theoretical upper limits (Pearson               r               \,=~0.85,               p               \,{$<$}\,0.001,               N               \,=\,608; in line with most metrics of rating scale reliability). These findings suggest an avenue for modernizing the ubiquitous questionnaire and ultimately opening doors to a greater understanding of the human condition.},

Recent significant advances in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Deep Learning (DL), namely transformers, have resulted in large performance gains in tasks related to understanding natural language such as machine translation. However, these state-of-the-art methods have not yet been made easily accessible for psychology researchers, nor designed to be optimal for human-level analyses. This tutorial introduces text (www.r-text.org), a new R-package for analyzing and visualizing human language using transformers, the latest techniques from NLP and DL. The text package is both a modular solution for accessing state-of-the-art language models and an end-to-end solution catered for human-level analyses. Hence, text provides user-friendly functions tailored to test hypotheses in social sciences for both relatively small and large datasets. This tutorial describes useful methods for analyzing text, providing functions with reliable defaults that can be used off-the-shelf as well as providing a framework for the advanced users to build on for novel techniques and analysis pipelines. The reader learns about three core methods: 1) textEmbed: to transform text to traditional or modern transformer-based word embeddings (i.e., numeric representations of words); 2) textTrain and textPredict: to train predictive models with word embeddings as input, and use the models to predict from; 3) textSimilarity: to compute semantic similarity scores between texts. The reader also learns about two extended methods: 1) textSimilarityTest: to significance test the difference in meaning between two sets of texts; and 2) textProjection and textProjectionPlot: to examine and visualize text within the embedding space according to latent or specified construct dimensions (e.g., low to high rating scale scores).},

  abstract = {The expression and recognition of emotions (i.e., short-lived and directed representations of affective states) through the acoustic properties of speech is a unique feature of human communication (Weninger et al., 2013). Researchers have identified acoustic features, which are predictable of affective states, and emotion detecting algorithms have been developed (Schuller, 2018). However, most studies used speech data produced by actors, who had instructions to act out a given emotion, or speech samples labelled by raters, who were instructed to add affective labels to recorded utterances (e.g., from TV shows). Both, enacted and labelled speech, come with multiple downsides since these approaches assess expressed affect rather than the experience of actual affective states through voice. In this work, we want to investigate if we can predict in-situ self-reported affective states from objective voice parameters collected with smartphones in everyday life. Further, we want to explore which acoustic features are most predictive for the prediction of the experience of affective states. Finally, we want to analyze how the affective quality of instructed spoken language (e.g., a sentence with negative affective valence) translates into objective markers in the acoustic signal, which then in turn could alter the predictions in our models.},

Yet, we hypothesized that in the presence of spectrotemporal signal degradations, as imposed by cochlear implants (CIs) and vocoders, acoustic cues that overlap for voice perception and phonemic categorization could be mistaken for one another, leading to a strong interaction between linguistic and indexical (talker-specific) content. Fifteen normal-hearing participants performed an odd-one-out adaptive task measuring just-noticeable differences (JNDs) in F0 and VTL. Items used were words (lexical content) or time-reversed words (no lexical content). The use of lexical content was either promoted (by using variable items across comparison intervals) or not (fixed item). Finally, stimuli were presented without or with vocoding. Results showed that JNDs for both F0 and VTL were significantly smaller (better) for non-vocoded compared with vocoded speech and for fixed compared with variable items. Lexical content (forward vs reversed) affected VTL JNDs in the variable item condition, but F0 JNDs only in the non-vocoded, fixed condition. In conclusion, lexical content had a positive top--down effect on VTL perception when acoustic and linguistic variability was present but not on F0 perception. Lexical advantage persisted in the most degraded conditions and vocoding even enhanced the effect of item variability, suggesting that linguistic content could support compensation for poor voice perception in CI users.},

  abstract = {To communicate emotionally entails that a listener understands a verbal message but also the emotional prosody going along with it. So far the time course and interaction of these emotional `channels' is still poorly understood. The current set of event-related brain potential (ERP) experiments investigated both the interactive time course of emotional prosody with semantics and of emotional prosody independent of emotional semantics using a cross-splicing method. In a probe verification task (Experiment 1) prosodic expectancy violations elicited a positivity, while a combined prosodic--semantic expectancy violation elicited a negativity. Comparable ERP results were obtained in an emotional prosodic categorization task (Experiment 2). The present data support different ERP responses with distinct time courses and topographies elicited as a function of prosodic expectancy and combined prosodic-semantic expectancy during emotional prosodic processing and combined emotional prosody/emotional semantic processing. These differences suggest that the interaction of more than one emotional channel facilitates subtle transitions in an emotional sentence context.},

Among the sensors most commonly found in such devices are microphones. While various privacy concerns related to microphone-equipped devices have been raised and thoroughly discussed, the threat of unexpected inferences from audio data remains largely overlooked. Drawing from literature of diverse disciplines, this paper presents an overview of sensitive pieces of information that can, with the help of advanced data analysis methods, be derived from human speech and other acoustic elements in recorded audio. In addition to the linguistic content of speech, a speaker's voice characteristics and manner of expression may implicitly contain a rich array of personal information, including cues to a speaker's biometric identity, personality, physical traits, geographical origin, emotions, level of intoxication and sleepiness, age, gender, and health condition. Even a person's socioeconomic status can be reflected in certain speech patterns. The findings compiled in this paper demonstrate that recent advances in voice and speech processing induce a new generation of privacy threats.},

  abstract = {Psychologists have long debated whether it is possible to assess how people subjectively feel without asking them. The recent proliferation of online social networks has recently added a fresh chapter to this discussion, with research now suggesting that it is possible to index people's subjective experience of emotion by simply counting the number of emotion words contained in their online social network posts. Whether the conclusions that emerge from this work are valid, however, rests on a critical assumption: that people's usage of emotion words in their posts accurately reflects how they feel. Although this assumption is widespread in psychological research, here we suggest that there are reasons to challenge it. We corroborate these assertions in 2 ways. First, using data from 4 experience-sampling studies of emotion in young adults, we show that people's reports of how they feel throughout the day neither predict, nor are predicted by, their use of emotion words on Facebook. Second, using simulations we show that although significant relationships emerge between the use of emotion words on Facebook and self-reported affect with increasingly large numbers of observations, the relationship between these variables was in the opposite of the theoretically expected direction 50\% of the time (i.e., 3 of 6 models that we performed simulations on). In contrast to counting emotion words, we show that judges' ratings of the emotionality of participants' Facebook posts consistently predicts how people feel across all analyses. These findings shed light on how to draw inferences about emotion using online social network data.},

  abstract = {People display a remarkable variability in the patterns and trajectories with which their feelings change over time. In this article, we present a theoretical account for the dynamics of affect (DynAffect) that identifies the major processes underlying individual differences in the temporal dynamics of affective experiences. It is hypothesized that individuals are characterized by an affective home base, a baseline attractor state around which affect fluctuates. These fluctuations vary as the result of internal or external processes to which an individual is more or less sensitive and are regulated and tied back to the home base by the attractor strength. Individual differences in these 3 processes--affective home base, variability, and attractor strength--are proposed to underlie individual differences in affect dynamics. The DynAffect account is empirically evaluated by means of a diffusion modeling approach in 2 extensive experience-sampling studies on people's core affective experiences. The findings show that the model is capable of adequately capturing the observed dynamics in core affect across both large (Study 1) and shorter time scales (Study 2) and illuminate how the key processes are related to personality and emotion dispositions. Implications for the understanding of affect dynamics and affective dysfunctioning in psychopathology are also discussed.},

In two studies, we examined two possible sources of this variation: personality and culture. Method: In Study 1, participants (Belgian university students) recalled a recent event that was characterized by high or low valence or arousal and reported on their feelings and their personality in terms of the Five-Factor Model. In Study 2, participants from Canada, China/Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, and Spain reported on their feelings in a thin slice of time and on their personality. Results: In Study 1, we replicated the V-shape as characterizing the relation between valence and arousal, and identified personality correlates of experiencing particular valence--arousal combinations. In Study 2, we documented how the V-shaped relation varied as a function of Western versus Eastern cultural background and personality. Conclusions: The results showed that the steepness of the V-shaped relation between valence and arousal increases with Extraversion within cultures, and with a West-East distinction between cultures. Implications for the personality--emotion link and research on cultural differences in affect are discussed.},

The portrayals were also acoustically analysed with respect to 20 vocal cues (e.g., speech rate, voice intensity, fundamental frequency, spectral energy distribution). The results showed that: (a) there were distinct patterns of ratings of activation, valence, and potency for the different emotions; (b) all four emotion dimensions were correlated with several vocal cues; (c) listeners' ratings could be successfully predicted from the vocal cues for all dimensions except valence; and (d) the intensity dimension was positively correlated with the activation dimension in the listeners' ratings.},

In doing so, it provides the first direct test of a key proposition of dialect theory, namely that greater accuracy of detecting emotions from one's own cultural group-known as in-group advantage-results from a match between culturally specific schemas in emotional expression style and culturally specific schemas in emotion recognition. Study 1 used stimuli from 100 professional actors from five English-speaking nations vocally conveying 11 emotional states (anger, contempt, fear, happiness, interest, lust, neutral, pride, relief, sadness, and shame) using standard-content sentences. Detailed acoustic analyses showed many similarities across groups, and yet also systematic group differences. This provides evidence for cultural accents in expressive style at the level of acoustic cues. In Study 2, listeners evaluated these expressions in a 5 {\texttimes} 5 design balanced across groups. Cross-cultural accuracy was greater than expected by chance. However, there was also in-group advantage, which varied across emotions. A lens model analysis of fundamental acoustic properties examined patterns in emotional expression and perception within and across groups. Acoustic cues were used relatively similarly across groups both to produce and judge emotions, and yet there were also subtle cultural differences. Speakers appear to have a culturally nuanced schema for enacting vocal tones via acoustic cues, and perceivers have a culturally nuanced schema in judging them. Consistent with dialect theory's prediction, in-group judgments showed a greater match between these schemas used for emotional expression and perception. (PsycINFO Database Record},

In investigations of vocal emotion recognition, there is considerable variability in the types of stimuli and procedures used to examine their influence on emotion recognition. In addition, accurate metacognition was argued to promote correct and confident interpretations in emotion recognition tasks. Nevertheless, such associations have rarely been studied previously. We addressed this gap by examining the impact of vocal stimulus type and prosodic speech attributes on emotion recognition and a person's confidence in a given response. We analysed a total of 1038 emotional expressions according to a baseline set of 13 prosodic acoustic parameters. Results showed that these parameters provided sufficient discrimination between expressions of emotional categories to permit accurate statistical classification. Emotion recognition and confidence judgments were found to depend on stimulus material as they could be reliably predicted by different constellations of acoustic features. Finally, results indicated that listeners' accuracy and confidence judgements were significantly higher for affect bursts than speech-embedded stimuli and that the correct classification of emotional expressions elicited increased confidence judgements. Together, these findings show that vocal stimulus type and prosodic attributes of speech strongly influence emotion recognition and listeners' confidence in these given responses.},

Additionally, we examined the amount of variance in language use (assessed by both methods) that can be attributed to intra-individual variability and stable individual differences. Study 1 was focused on investigating language use obtained from 74 respondents using the EAR for 3 consecutive days. Study 2 was conducted on 250 respondents participating in a SOC task where verbal production was collected at ten time points over a 2-month period. Results show that measures obtained using the SOC task have higher temporal stability and consistency, and to a certain extent enable better detection of individual differences.

However, emotion is not only biologically determined, but is also influenced by the environment. Therefore, cultural differences exist in some aspects of emotions, one such important aspect of emotion being emotional arousal level. All affective states are systematically represented as two bipolar dimensions, valence and arousal. Arousal level of actual and ideal emotions has consistently been found to have cross-cultural differences. In Western or individualist culture, high arousal emotions are valued and promoted more than low arousal emotions. Moreover, Westerners experience high arousal emotions more than low arousal emotions. By contrast, in Eastern or collectivist culture, low arousal emotions are valued more than high arousal emotions. Moreover, people in the East actually experience and prefer to experience low arousal emotions more than high arousal emotions. Mechanism of these cross-cultural differences and implications are also discussed.},

Previous studies on linguistic versus paralinguistic salience effects in emotional          speech processing have produced inconsistent findings. In this study, we investigated          the relative perceptual saliency of emotion cues in cross-channel auditory alone task          (i.e., semantics--prosody Stroop task) and cross-modal audiovisual task (i.e., semantics--prosody--face          Stroop task).              Method       Thirty normal Chinese adults participated in two Stroop experiments with spoken emotion          adjectives in Mandarin Chinese. Experiment 1 manipulated auditory pairing of emotional          prosody (happy or sad) and lexical semantic content in congruent and incongruent conditions.          Experiment 2 extended the protocol to cross-modal integration by introducing visual          facial expression during auditory stimulus presentation. Participants were asked to          judge emotional information for each test trial according to the instruction of selective          attention.              Results       Accuracy and reaction time data indicated that, despite an increase in cognitive demand          and task complexity in Experiment 2, prosody was consistently more salient than semantic          content for emotion word processing and did not take precedence over facial expression.          While congruent stimuli enhanced performance in both experiments, the facilitatory          effect was smaller in Experiment 2.              Conclusion       Together, the results demonstrate the salient role of paralinguistic prosodic cues          in emotion word processing and congruence facilitation effect in multisensory integration.

The ability to accurately and efficiently predict mood from easily collectible data has several important implications towards the early detection and intervention of mental health disorders. One promising data source to help monitor human behavior is from daily smartphone usage. However, care must be taken to summarize behaviors without identifying the user through personal (e.g., personally identifiable information) or protected attributes (e.g., race, gender). In this paper, we study behavioral markers or daily mood using a recent dataset of mobile behaviors from high-risk adolescent populations. Using computational models, we find that multimodal modeling of both text and app usage features is highly predictive of daily mood over each modality alone. Furthermore, we evaluate approaches that reliably obfuscate user identity while remaining predictive of daily mood. By combining multimodal representations with privacy-preserving learning, we are able to push forward the performance-privacy frontier as compared to unimodal approaches.},

  abstract = {Language model pretraining has led to significant performance gains but careful comparison between different approaches is challenging. Training is computationally expensive, often done on private datasets of different sizes, and, as we will show, hyperparameter choices have significant impact on the final results. We present a replication study of BERT pretraining (Devlin et al., 2019) that carefully measures the impact of many key hyperparameters and training data size. We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every model published after it. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD. These results highlight the importance of previously overlooked design choices, and raise questions about the source of recently reported improvements. We release our models and code.},

  abstract = {Speech is a powerful medium through which a variety of psychologically relevant phenomena are expressed. Here we take a first step in evaluating the potential of using voice samples as non-self-report measures of personality. In particular, we examine the extent to which linguistic and vocal information extracted from semi-structured vocal samples can be used to predict conventional measures of personality. We extracted 94 linguistic features (using Linquistic Inquiry Word Count, 2015) and 272 vocal features (using pyAudioAnalysis) from 614 voice samples of at least 50 words. Using a two-stage, fully automatable machine learning pipeline we evaluated the extent to which these features predicted self-report personality scales (Big Five Inventory). For comparison purposes, we also examined the predictive performance of these voice features with respect to depression, age, and gender. Results showed that voice samples accounted for 10.67~\% of the variance in personality traits on average and that the same samples could also predict depression, age, and gender. Moreover, the results reported here provide a conservative estimate of the degree to which features derived from voice samples could be used to predict personality traits and suggest a number of opportunities to optimize personality prediction and better understand how voice samples carry information about personality.},

Using degree of depression as a case study, we do an empirical analysis on which off-the-shelf language model, individual layers, and combinations of layers seem most promising when applied to human-level NLP tasks. Notably, we find RoBERTa most effective and, despite the standard in past work suggesting the second-to-last or concatenation of the last 4 layers, we find layer 19 (sixth-to last) is at least as good as layer 23 when using 1 layer. Further, when using multiple layers, distributing them across the second half (i.e. Layers 12+), rather than last 4, of the 24 layers yielded the most accurate results.},

  abstract = {Mood inference with mobile sensing data has been studied in ubicomp literature over the last decade. This inference enables context-aware and personalized user experiences in general mobile apps and valuable feedback and interventions in mobile health apps. However, even though model generalization issues have been highlighted in many studies, the focus has always been on improving the accuracies of models using different sensing modalities and machine learning techniques, with datasets collected in homogeneous populations. In contrast, less attention has been given to studying the performance of mood inference models to assess whether models generalize to new countries. In this study, we collected a mobile sensing dataset with 329K self-reports from 678 participants in eight countries (China, Denmark, India, Italy, Mexico, Mongolia, Paraguay, UK) to assess the effect of geographical diversity on mood inference models. We define and evaluate country-specific (trained and tested within a country), continent-specific (trained and tested within a continent), country-agnostic (tested on a country not seen on training data), and multi-country (trained and tested with multiple countries) approaches trained on sensor data for two mood inference tasks with population-level (non-personalized) and hybrid (partially personalized) models. We show that partially personalized country-specific models perform the best yielding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) scores of the range 0.78--0.98 for two-class (negative vs. positive valence) and 0.76--0.94 for three-class (negative vs. neutral vs. positive valence) inference. Further, with the country-agnostic approach, we show that models do not perform well compared to country-specific settings, even when models are partially personalized. We also show that continent-specific models outperform multi-country models in the case of Europe. Overall, we uncover generalization issues of mood inference models to new countries and how the geographical similarity of countries might impact mood inference.},

Technically, the EAR is an audio recorder that intermittently records snippets of ambient sounds while participants go about their lives. Conceptually, it is a naturalistic observation method that yields an acoustic log of a person's day as it unfolds. The power of the EAR lies in unobtrusively collecting authentic real-life observational data. In preserving a high degree of naturalism at the level of the raw recordings, it resembles ethnographic methods; through its sampling and coding, it enables larger empirical studies. This article provides an overview of the EAR method; reviews its validity, utility, and limitations; and discusses it in the context of current developments in ambulatory assessment, specifically the emerging field of mobile sensing.},

This report is the first to date which systematically tests the efficacy of different sampling strategies for characterizing behavior from audio recordings to provide practical guidelines for researchers. Using continuous audio recordings of the daily lives of 11 preschoolaged children, we compared sampling techniques to determine the most accurate and efficient approach. Results suggest that sampling both low and high frequency verbal and overt behaviors is best if samples are short in duration, systematically rather than randomly selected, and sampled to cover at least 12.5\% of recordings. Implications for assessment of real-world behavior are discussed.},

Although smartphones were not designed for psychological research, they can collect vast amounts of ecologically valid data, easily and quickly, from large global samples. If participants download the right "psych apps," smartphones can record where they are, what they are doing, and what they can see and hear and can run interactive surveys, tests, and experiments through touch screens and wireless connections to nearby screens, headsets, biosensors, and other peripherals. This article reviews previous behavioral research using mobile electronic devices, outlines what smartphones can do now and will be able to do in the near future, explains how a smartphone study could work practically given current technology (e.g., in studying ovulatory cycle effects on women's sexuality), discusses some limitations and challenges of smartphone research, and compares smartphones to other research methods. Smartphone research will require new skills in app development and data analysis and will raise tough new ethical issues, but smartphones could transform psychology even more profoundly than PCs and brain imaging did.},

Besides more prominent examples like self-driving cars or media consumption algorithms, AI-based systems have further started to gain more and more popularity in the health care sector, however whilst being restrained by high requirements for accuracy, robustness, and explainability. Health-oriented AI research as a sub-field of digital health investigates a plethora of human-centered modalities. In this article, we address recent advances in the so far understudied but highly promising audio domain with a particular focus on speech data and present corresponding state-of-the-art technologies. Moreover, we give an excerpt of recent studies on the automatic audio-based detection of diseases ranging from acute and chronic respiratory diseases via psychiatric disorders to developmental disorders and neurodegenerative disorders. Our selection of presented literature shows that the recent success of deep learning methods in other fields of AI also more and more translates to the field of digital health, albeit expert-designed feature extractors and classical ML methodologies are still prominently used. Limiting factors, especially for speech-based disease detection systems, are related to the amount and diversity of available data, e. g., the number of patients and healthy controls as well as the underlying distribution of age, languages, and cultures. Finally, we contextualize and outline application scenarios of speech-based disease detection systems as supportive tools for health-care professionals under ethical consideration of privacy protection and faulty prediction.},

Although automatic speech recognition software is commercially available, its accuracy in mental health settings has not been well described. It is unclear which metrics and thresholds are appropriate for different clinical use cases, which may range from population descriptions to individual safety monitoring. Here we show that automatic speech recognition is feasible in psychotherapy, but further improvements in accuracy are needed before widespread use. Our HIPAA-compliant automatic speech recognition system demonstrated a transcription word error rate of 25\%. For depression-related utterances, sensitivity was 80\% and positive predictive value was 83\%. For clinician-identified harm-related sentences, the word error rate was 34\%. These results suggest that automatic speech recognition may support understanding of language patterns and subgroup variation in existing treatments but may not be ready for individual-level safety surveillance.},

Recent advances in research on mobile sensing technologies and machine learning have suggested that a person's depression can be passively measured by observing patterns in people's mobility behaviors. However, the majority of work in this area has relied on highly homogeneous samples, most frequently college students. In this study, we analyse over 57 million GPS data points to show that the same procedure that leads to high prediction accuracy in a homogeneous student sample (N = 57; AUC = 0.82), leads to accuracies only slightly higher than chance in a U.S.-wide sample that is heterogeneous in its socio-demographic composition as well as mobility patterns (N = 5,262; AUC = 0.57). This pattern holds across three different modelling approaches which consider both linear and non-linear relationships. Further analyses suggest that the prediction accuracy is low across different socio-demographic groups, and that training the models on more homogeneous subsamples does not substantially improve prediction accuracy. Overall, the findings highlight the challenge of applying mobility-based predictions of depression at scale.},

Such tests should take into account the variability due to the choice of training set and not only that due to the test examples, as is often the case. This could lead to gross underestimation of the variance of the cross-validation estimator, and to the wrong conclusion that the new algorithm is significantly better when it is not. We perform a theoretical investigation of the variance of a variant of the cross-validation estimator of the generalization error that takes into account the variability due to the randomness of the training set as well as test examples. Our analysis shows that all the variance estimators that are based only on the results of the cross-validation experiment must be biased. This analysis allows us to propose new estimators of this variance. We show, via simulations, that tests of hypothesis about the generalization error using those new variance estimators have better properties than tests involving variance estimators currently in use and listed in Dietterich (1998). In particular, the new tests have correct size and good power. That is, the new tests do not reject the null hypothesis too often when the hypothesis is true, but they tend to frequently reject the null hypothesis when the latter is false.},

Listeners were presented with words that had either a happy, sad, or neutral meaning. Each word was spoken in a tone of voice (happy, sad, or neutral) that was congruent, incongruent, or neutral with respect to affective meaning, and naming latencies were collected. Across experiments, tone of voice was either blocked or mixed with respect to emotional meaning. The results suggest that emotional tone of voice facilitated linguistic processing of emotional words in an emotion-congruent fashion. These findings suggest that information about emotional tone is used in the processing of linguistic content influencing the recognition and naming of spoken words in an emotion-congruent manner.},

  abstract = {This investigation examined whether speakers produce reliable prosodic correlates to meaning across semantic domains and whether listeners use these cues to derive word meaning from novel words. Speakers were asked to produce phrases in infant-directed speech in which novel words were used to convey one of two meanings from a set of antonym pairs (e.g., big/small). Acoustic analyses revealed that some acoustic features were correlated with overall valence of the meaning. However, each word meaning also displayed a unique acoustic signature, and semantically related meanings elicited similar acoustic profiles. In two perceptual tests, listeners either attempted to identify the novel words with a matching meaning dimension (picture pair) or with mismatched meaning dimensions. Listeners inferred the meaning of the novel words significantly more often when prosody matched the word meaning choices than when prosody mismatched. These findings suggest that speech contains reliable prosodic markers to word meaning and that listeners use these prosodic cues to differentiate meanings. That prosody is semantic suggests a reconceptualization of traditional distinctions between linguistic and nonlinguistic properties of spoken language.},

In terms of acoustic modeling we generate statistics from acoustic audio descriptors, e.g. pitch, loudness, spectral characteristics. Ranking our features we see that loudness and MFCC seem most promising for all databases. For the English database also pitch features are important. In terms of linguistic modeling we apply probabilistic and entropy-based models of words and phrases, e.g. Bag-of-Words (BOW), Term Frequency (TF), Term Frequency -- Inverse Document Frequency (TF.IDF) and the Self-Referential Information (SRI). SRI clearly outperforms vector space models. Modeling phrases slightly improves the scores. After classification of both acoustic and linguistic information on separated levels we fuse information on decision level adding confidences. We compare the obtained scores on three different databases. Two databases are taken from the IVR customer care domain, another database accounts for a WoZ data collection. All corpora are of realistic speech condition. We observe promising results for the IVR databases while the WoZ database shows lower scores overall. In order to provide comparability between the results we evaluate classification success using the f1 measurement in addition to overall accuracy figures. As a result, acoustic modeling clearly outperforms linguistic modeling. Fusion slightly improves overall scores. With a baseline of approximately 60\% accuracy and .40 f1-measurement by constant majority class voting we obtain an accuracy of 75\% with respective .70 f1 for the WoZ database. For the IVR databases we obtain approximately 79\% accuracy with respective .78 f1 over a baseline of 60\% accuracy with respective .38 f1.},

The circumplex model of affect is more consistent with many recent findings from behavioral, cognitive neuroscience, neuroimaging, and developmental studies of affect. Moreover, the model offers new theoretical and empirical approaches to studying the development of affective disorders as well as the genetic and cognitive underpinnings of affective processing within the central nervous system.},

  abstract = {Opportunistic affect sensing offers unprecedented potential for capturing spontaneous affect, eliminating biases inherent in the controlled setting. Facial expression and voice are two major affective displays, however most affect sensing systems on smartphone avoid them due to extensive power requirements. Encouragingly, due to the recent advent of low-power DSP (Digital Signal Processing) co-processor and GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) technology, audio and video sensing are becoming more feasible on smartphone. To utilize opportunistically captured facial expression and voice, gathering contextual information about the dynamic audiovisual stimuli is also important. This paper discusses recent advances of affect sensing on the smartphone and identifies the key barriers and potential solutions for implementing opportunistic and context-aware affect sensing on smartphone platforms. In addition to exploring the technical challenges (privacy, battery life and robust algorithms), the challenges of recruiting and retention of mental health patients have also been considered; as experimentation with mental health patients is difficult but crucial to showcase the importance/effectiveness of the smartphone centred affect sensing technology.},

Because methodological guidance on assessing and reporting reliability at multiple levels of analysis is currently lacking, we discuss the importance of examining level-specific reliability. We present a simulation study and an applied example showing different methods for estimating multilevel reliability using multilevel confirmatory factor analysis and provide supporting Mplus program code. We conclude that (a) single-level estimates will not reflect a scale's actual reliability unless reliability is identical at each level of analysis, (b) 2-level alpha and composite reliability (omega) perform relatively well in most settings, (c) estimates of maximal reliability (H) were more biased when estimated using multilevel data than either alpha or omega, and (d) small cluster size can lead to overestimates of reliability at the between level of analysis. We also show that Monte Carlo confidence intervals and Bayesian credible intervals closely reflect the sampling distribution of reliability estimates under most conditions. We discuss the estimation of credible intervals using Mplus and provide R code for computing Monte Carlo confidence intervals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {Factor-analytic evidence has led most psychologists to describe affect as a set of dimensions, such as displeasure, distress, depression, excitement, and so on, with each dimension varying independently of the others. However, there is other evidence that rather than being independent, these affective dimensions are interrelated in a highly systematic fashion. The evidence suggests that these interrelationships can be represented by a spatial model in which affective concepts fall in a circle in the following order: pleasure (0), excitement (45), arousal (90), distress (135), displeasure (180), depression (225), sleepiness (270), and relaxation (315). This model was offered both as a way psychologists can represent the structure of affective experience, as assessed through self-report, and as a representation of the cognitive structure that laymen utilize in conceptualizing affect. Supportive evidence was obtained by scaling 28 emotion-denoting adjectives in 4 different ways: R. T. Ross's (1938) technique for a circular ordering of variables, a multidimensional scaling procedure based on perceived similarity among the terms, a unidimensional scaling on hypothesized pleasure--displeasure and degree-of-arousal dimensions, and a principal-components analysis of 343 Ss' self-reports of their current affective states.

The latter is explained by (a) a paucity of research on voice quality, (b) neglect of the social signaling functions of affect vocalization, and (c) insufficiently precise conceptualization of the underlying emotional states. A component-patterning model of vocal affect expression is proposed that attempts to link the outcomes of antecedent event evaluation to biologically based response patterns. The likely phonatory and articulatory correlates of the physiological responses characterizing different emotional states are described in the form of 3 major voice types (narrow/wide, lax/tense, full/thin). Specific predictions about changes in acoustic parameters resulting from changing voice types are compared with the pattern of empirical findings yielded by a comprehensive survey of the literature on vocal cues in emotional expression. Although the comparison is largely limited to the lax/tense voice type (because acoustic parameters relevant to the other voice types have not yet been systematically studied), a high degree of convergence is revealed.

While situational data were previously difficult to collect, the ubiquity of smartphones now opens up new opportunities for assessing situations in situ, that is, while they occur. Seizing this development, the present study demonstrates how smartphones can help establish associations between the psychological perception and the physical reality of situations. We employed an intensive longitudinal sampling design and investigated 9,790 situational snapshots experienced by 455 participants for 14 consecutive days. These snapshots combined self-reported situation characteristics from experience samplings with their corresponding objective situation cues obtained via smartphone sensing. To account for the complexity of real-world situations, we extracted a total of 1,356 granular situation cues from different sensing modalities. We applied linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms to examine how well these cues predicted the perceived characteristics in terms of the Situational Eight DIAMONDS, finding significant out-of-sample predictions for the five dimensions capturing the situations' Duty, Intellect, Mating, pOsitivity, and Sociality. Analyses of (grouped) feature importance revealed that these predictions relied on complex constellations of cues representing various situational information about the Persons/Interactions and Objects present, the Events/Activities happening, and the current Location and Time. Furthermore, a nomological network analysis provided evidence for the construct validity of our cue-based DIAMONDS predictions. We conclude by discussing how smartphone-based situational snapshots, in general, and our prediction models, in particular, advance psychological research on situations.},

We predicted that beyond conveying the contents of a person's mind, a person's speech also conveys mental capacity, such that hearing a person explain his or her beliefs makes the person seem more mentally capable---and therefore seem to possess more uniquely human mental traits---than reading the same content. We expected this effect to emerge when people are perceived as relatively mindless, such as when they disagree with the evaluator's own beliefs. Three experiments involving polarizing attitudinal issues and political opinions supported these hypotheses. A fourth experiment identified paralinguistic cues in the human voice that convey basic mental capacities. These results suggest that the medium through which people communicate may systematically influence the impressions they form of each other. The tendency to denigrate the minds of the opposition may be tempered by giving them, quite literally, a voice.},

Given sufficient data, this approach seemingly works well enough. Yet, this paper tries to answer the question whether acoustic emotion recognition strongly depends on phonetic content, and if models tailored for the spoken unit can lead to higher accuracies. We therefore investigate phoneme-, and word-models by use of a large prosodic, spectral, and voice quality feature space and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Experiments also take the necessity of ASR into account to select appropriate unitmodels. Test-runs on the well-known EMO-DB database facing speaker-independence demonstrate superiority of word emotion models over today's common general models provided sufficient occurrences in the training corpus.},

  abstract = {Recognition of emotion in speech usually uses acoustic models that ignore the spoken content. Likewise one general model per emotion is trained independent of the phonetic structure. Given sufficient data, this approach seemingly works well enough. Yet, this paper tries to answer the question whether acoustic emotion recognition strongly depends on phonetic content, and if models tailored for the spoken unit can lead to higher accuracies. We therefore investigate phoneme-, and word-models by use of a large prosodic, spectral, and voice quality feature space and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Experiments also take the necessity of ASR into account to select appropriate unitmodels. Test-runs on the well-known EMO-DB database facing speaker-independence demonstrate superiority of word emotion models over today's common general models provided sufficient occurrences in the training corpus.},

Many questions remain regarding how different sources of emotional cues in speech (e.g., prosody, semantic information) are processed during emotional communication. Using a cross-modal emotional priming paradigm (Facial affect decision task), we compared the relative contributions of processing utterances with single-channel (prosody-only) versus multi-channel (prosody and semantic) cues on the perception of happy, sad, and angry emotional expressions. Our data show that emotional speech cues produce robust congruency effects on decisions about an emotionally related face target, although no processing advantage occurred when prime stimuli contained multi-channel as opposed to single-channel speech cues. Our data suggest that utterances with prosodic cues alone and utterances with combined prosody and semantic cues both activate knowledge that leads to emotional congruency (priming) effects, but that the convergence of these two information sources does not always heighten access to this knowledge during emotional speech processing.},

Oscillographic records of the vowels were made and analyzed. Results showed that the vocal responses to stimuli which evoke happiness are appreciably higher in pitch than the ordinary tones of the same subjects and higher than tones representative of sad states. This difference was found to be significant in both sexes. The average tones in response to literature or music judged as sad are practically the same as that of the subjects' ordinary tones. Differences in intensity and in tone quality were also observed for the two emotional states. Psychogalvanic readings taken during the experiment showed the presence of disturbances of an emotional nature. A second experiment to determine the subjects' conception of ordinary, soft, and loud tones showed that pitch changes with the intensity of the tones. Soft tones are lower in pitch than those designated as ordinary, and loud tones are invariably higher in pitch than either. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)},

  abstract = {The prediction of valence from speech is an important, but challenging problem. The expression of valence in speech has speaker-dependent cues, which contribute to performances that are often significantly lower than the prediction of other emotional attributes such as arousal and dominance. A practical approach to improve valence prediction from speech is to adapt the models to the target speakers in the test set. Adapting a speech emotion recognition (SER) system to a particular speaker is a hard problem, especially with deep neural networks (DNNs), since it requires optimizing millions of parameters. This study proposes an unsupervised approach to address this problem by searching for speakers in the train set with similar acoustic patterns as the speaker in the test set. Speech samples from the selected speakers are used to create the adaptation set. This approach leverages transfer learning using pre-trained models, which are adapted with these speech samples. We propose three alternative adaptation strategies: unique speaker, oversampling and weighting approaches. These methods differ on the use of the adaptation set in the personalization of the valence models. The results demonstrate that a valence prediction model can be efficiently personalized with these unsupervised approaches, leading to relative improvements as high as 13.52\%.},

  abstract = {The extreme acoustic variability of speech is well established, which makes the proficiency of human speech perception all the more impressive. Speech perception, like perception in any modality, is relative to context, and this provides a means to normalize the acoustic variability in the speech signal. Acoustic context effects in speech perception have been widely documented, but a clear understanding of how these effects relate to each other across stimuli, timescales, and acoustic domains is lacking. Here we review the influences that spectral context, temporal context, and spectrotemporal context have on speech perception. Studies are organized in terms of whether the context precedes the target (forward effects) or follows it (backward effects), and whether the context is adjacent to the target (proximal) or temporally removed from it (distal). Special cases where proximal and distal contexts have competing influences on perception are also considered. Across studies, a common theme emerges: acoustic differences between contexts and targets are perceptually magnified, producing contrast effects that facilitate perception of target sounds and words. This indicates enhanced sensitivity to changes in the acoustic environment, which maximizes the amount of potential information that can be transmitted to the perceiver. This article is categorized under: Linguistics {$>$} Language in Mind and Brain Psychology {$>$} Perception and Psychophysics Acoustic context effects in speech perception. Contexts can be temporally adjacent to the target speech sound (proximal) or temporally nonadjacent to the target (distal). Contexts that precede the target in time are forward effects; contexts that follow the target are backward effects. These combinations of context timescales and directions apply equally to spectral context effects and temporal context effects in speech perception},

We explored within-person associations between spoken words and self-reported state emotion among 185 participants who wore the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR; an unobtrusive audio recording device) and completed experience sampling reports of their positive and negative emotions 4 times per day for 7 days (1,579 observations). We examined language using the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count program (LIWC; theoretically created dictionaries) and open-vocabulary themes (clusters of data-driven semantically-related words). Although some studies give the impression that LIWC's positive and negative emotion dictionaries can be used as indicators of emotion experience, we found that when computed on spoken language, LIWC emotion scores were not significantly associated with self-reports of state emotion experience. Exploration of other categories of language variables suggests a number of hypotheses about substantive everyday correlates of momentary positive and negative emotion that can be tested in future studies. These findings (a) suggest that LIWC positive and negative emotion dictionaries may not capture self-reported subjective emotion experience when applied to everyday speech, (b) emphasize the importance of establishing the validity of language-based measures within one's target domain, (c) demonstrate the potential for developing new hypotheses about personality processes from the open-ended words that are used in everyday speech, and (d) extend perspectives on intraindividual variability to the domain of spoken language.

  abstract = {Facial affect analysis aims to create new types of human--computer interactions by enabling computers to better understand a person's emotional state in order to provide ad hoc help and interactions. Since discrete emotional classes (such as anger, happiness, sadness and so on) are not representative of the full spectrum of emotions displayed by humans on a daily basis, psychologists typically rely on dimensional measures, namely valence (how positive the emotional display is) and arousal (how calming or exciting the emotional display looks like). However, while estimating these values from a face is natural for humans, it is extremely difficult for computer-based systems and automatic estimation of valence and arousal in naturalistic conditions is an open problem. Additionally, the subjectivity of these measures makes it hard to obtain good quality data. Here we introduce a novel deep neural network architecture to analyse facial affect in naturalistic conditions with a high level of accuracy. The proposed network integrates face alignment and jointly estimates both categorical and continuous emotions in a single pass, making it suitable for real-time applications. We test our method on three challenging datasets collected in naturalistic conditions and show that our approach outperforms all previous methods. We also discuss caveats regarding the use of this tool, and ethical aspects that must be considered in its application.},

Our models are fitted to a large collection of intended emotional prosody, yielding more than 3,000 minutes of recordings. Our descriptive study reveals that the mapping within corpora is relatively constant, whereas the mapping varies across corpora. To account for this heterogeneity, we fit a series of increasingly complex models. Model comparison reveals that models taking into account mapping differences across countries, languages, sexes and individuals outperform models that only assume a global mapping. Further analysis shows that differences across individuals, cultures and sexes contribute more to the model prediction than a shared global mapping. Our models, which can be explored in an online interactive visualization, offer a description of the mapping between acoustic features and emotions in prosody.},

  abstract = {In this paper we overview emotional speech recognition having in mind three goals. The first goal is to provide an up-todate record of the available emotional speech data collections. The number of emotional states, the language, the number of speakers, and the kind of speech are briefly addressed. The second goal is to present the most frequent acoustic features used for emotional speech recognition and to assess how the emotion affects them. Typical features are the pitch, the formants, the vocal tract cross-section areas, the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients, the Teager energy operator-based features, the intensity of the speech signal, and the speech rate. The third goal is to review appropriate techniques in order to classify speech into emotional states. We examine separately classification techniques that exploit timing information from which that ignore it. Classification techniques based on hidden Markov models, artificial neural networks, linear discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines are reviewed.},

  abstract = {In human-level NLP tasks, such as predicting mental health, personality, or demographics, the number of observations is often smaller than the standard 768+ hidden state sizes of each layer within modern transformer-based language models, limiting the ability to effectively leverage transformers. Here, we provide a systematic study on the role of dimension reduction methods (principal components analysis, factorization techniques, or multi-layer auto-encoders) as well as the dimensionality of embedding vectors and sample sizes as a function of predictive performance. We first find that fine-tuning large models with a limited amount of data pose a significant difficulty which can be overcome with a pre-trained dimension reduction regime. RoBERTa consistently achieves top performance in human-level tasks, with PCA giving benefit over other reduction methods in better handling users that write longer texts. Finally, we observe that a majority of the tasks achieve results comparable to the best performance with just 1/12 of the embedding dimensions.},

  abstract = {Acoustic Modeling in today's emotion recognition engines employs general models independent of the spoken phonetic content. This seems to work well enough given sufficient instances to cover for a broad variety of phonetic structures and emotions at the same time. However, data is usually sparse in the field and the question arises whether unit specific models as word emotion models could outperform the typical general models. In this respect this paper tries to answer the question how strongly acoustic emotion models depend on the textual and phonetic content. We investigate the influence on the turn and word level by use of state-of-the-art techniques for frame and word modeling on the well-known public Berlin Emotional Speech and Speech Under Simulated and Actual Stress databases. In the result it is clearly shown that the phonetic structure does strongly influence the accuracy of emotion recognition.},

Research so far has mostly dealt with offline evaluation of vocal emotions, and online processing has hardly been addressed. Online processing is, however, a necessary prerequisite for the realization of human-computer interfaces that analyze and respond to the user's emotions while he or she is interacting with an application. By means of a sample application, we demonstrate how the challenges arising from online processing may be solved. The overall objective of the paper is to help readers to assess the feasibility of human-computer interfaces that are sensitive to the user's emotional voice and to provide them with guidelines of how to technically realize such interfaces.},

We developed a public-speaking tutor on the Amazon Alexa platform that enables users to engage in cognitive reconstruction exercises. We also investigated how the sociability of the agent might affect its performance as a tutor. A user study of 53 college students with fear of public speaking showed that the interaction with the agent served to assuage pre-speech state anxiety. Agent sociability improved the sense of interpersonal closeness, which was associated with lower pre-speech anxiety. Moreover, sociability of the agent increased participants' satisfaction and their willingness to continue engagement. Our findings, thus, have implications not only for addressing public speaking anxiety in a scalable way but also for the design of future conversational agents using smart speaker platforms.},

Results from the StudentLife study show a number of significant correlations between the automatic objective sensor data from smartphones and mental health and educational outcomes of the student body. We also identify a Dartmouth term lifecycle in the data that shows students start the term with high positive affect and conversation levels, low stress, and healthy sleep and daily activity patterns. As the term progresses and the workload increases, stress appreciably rises while positive affect, sleep, conversation and activity drops off.

  abstract = {Recent popular claims surrounding virtual assistants suggest that computers will soon be able to hear our emotions. Supporting this possibility, promising work has harnessed big data and emergent technologies to automatically predict stable levels of one specific emotion, happiness, at the community (e.g., counties) and trait (i.e., people) levels. Furthermore, research in affective science has shown that nonverbal vocal bursts (e.g., sighs, gasps) and specific acoustic features (e.g., pitch, energy) can differentiate between distinct emotions (e.g., anger, happiness) and that machine-learning algorithms can detect these differences. Yet, to our knowledge, no work has tested whether computers can automatically detect normal, everyday, within-person fluctuations in one emotional state from acoustic analysis. To address this issue in the context of happy mood, across 3 studies (total N = 20,197), we asked participants to repeatedly report their state happy mood and to provide audio recordings-including both direct speech and ambient sounds-from which we extracted acoustic features. Using three different machine learning algorithms (neural networks, random forests, and support vector machines) and two sets of acoustic features, we found that acoustic features yielded minimal predictive insight into happy mood above chance. Neither multilevel modeling analyses nor human coders provided additional insight into state happy mood. These findings suggest that it is not yet possible to automatically assess fluctuations in one emotional state (i.e., happy mood) from acoustic analysis, pointing to a critical future direction for affective scientists interested in acoustic analysis of emotion and automated emotion detection.

  abstract = {Without doubt, there is emotional information in almost any kind of sound received by humans every day: be it the affective state of a person transmitted by means of speech; the emotion intended by a composer while writing a musical piece, or conveyed by a musician while performing it; or the affective state connected to an acoustic event occurring in the environment, in the soundtrack of a movie, or in a radio play. In the field of affective computing, there is currently some loosely connected research concerning either of these phenomena, but a holistic computational model of affect in sound is still lacking. In turn, for tomorrow's pervasive technical systems, including affective companions and robots, it is expected to be highly beneficial to understand the affective dimensions of ``the sound that something makes,'' in order to evaluate the system's auditory environment and its own audio output. This article aims at a first step toward a holistic computational model: starting from standard acoustic feature extraction schemes in the domains of speech, music, and sound analysis, we interpret the worth of individual features across these three domains, considering four audio databases with observer annotations in the arousal and valence dimensions. In the results, we find that by selection of appropriate descriptors, cross-domain arousal, and valence regression is feasible achieving significant correlations with the observer annotations of up to 0.78 for arousal (training on sound and testing on enacted speech) and 0.60 for valence (training on enacted speech and testing on music). The high degree of cross-domain consistency in encoding the two main dimensions of affect may be attributable to the co-evolution of speech and music from multimodal affect bursts, including the integration of nature sounds for expressive effects.},

  abstract = {Background: As mobile technologies become ever more sensor-rich, portable, and ubiquitous, data captured by smart devices are lending rich insights into users' daily lives with unprecedented comprehensiveness and ecological validity. A number of human-subject studies have been conducted to examine the use of mobile sensing to uncover individual behavioral patterns and health outcomes, yet minimal attention has been placed on measuring living environments together with other human-centered sensing data. Moreover, the participant sample size in most existing studies falls well below a few hundred, leaving questions open about the reliability of findings on the relations between mobile sensing signals and human outcomes. Results: To address these limitations, we developed a home environment sensor kit for continuous indoor air quality tracking and deployed it in conjunction with smartphones, Fitbits, and ecological momentary assessments in a cohort study of up to 1,584 college student participants per data type for 3 weeks. We propose a conceptual framework that systematically organizes human-centric data modalities by their temporal coverage and spatial freedom. Then we report our study procedure, technologies and methods deployed, and descriptive statistics of the collected data that reflect the participants' mood, sleep, behavior, and living environment. Conclusions: We were able to collect from a large participant cohort satisfactorily complete multi-modal sensing and survey data in terms of both data continuity and participant adherence. Our novel data and conceptual development provide important guidance for data collection and hypothesis generation in future human-centered sensing studies. {\copyright} 2021 The Author(s).
